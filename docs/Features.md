Rythm has a bunch of features packed into it to make sure the end user has the best experience possible while using Rythm.

## Play and Search
Rythm has the ability to play songs in your voice channel from sources such as **YouTube**, **Spotify** and **Soundcloud**. On top of being able to play songs, it can also play playlists which then get added to a queue system. Moreover, Rythm is also capable of searching for a song via your query and returning the top 10 results.
