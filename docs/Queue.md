## Rythm's Queue
---
  - If you try to play songs while another song is playing, or you try to play a playlist, Rythm will add those into a waiting queue. The order of the songs in queue is the order as you play them.

## Viewing the Queue
---
  - To view the queue, simply run `!queue` or `!q`. A nice-looking embed will pop up and list the songs you have added into the queue.

  - If there are multiple queue pages, you can either:
    + Do `!queue <Page Number>` to view that specific page. Example: `!queue 4`

    ![ViewingQueue2](/img/docs/queue/view-queue-2.png)

    + Use the reactions given to switch between pages.

## Managing the Queue
  - You can organize and manage your queue using commands. [Check here](/commands#queue) to view the list of queue commands.

:::info note
Rythm's maximum queue length is **10,000 songs**. This is adjustable via `MaxQueueLength` setting ([**More Info**](/settings#max-queue-length))
