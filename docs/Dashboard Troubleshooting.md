If you find yourself running into troubles while using the dashboard, this article should help you out!

## I can't pause, skip,... on the dashboard. What to do?
1. **Check if you have the `DJ` role or enough permissions in the server.** <br/>
Most of the features requires you to have the DJ role or `Manage Channels`/`Administrator` permissions. If you don't have any of those, you will only be able to add/remove your own songs and vote to skip.

2. **Check if you signed in with the correct account.** <br/>
You should see your name on the upper-right corner of the dashboard. If it isn't your Discord account, click on the name ➠ `Log Out`, then log in with the correct account.


:::tip
You should have full access to the dashboard if you see yourself on the `Admin` list (to the left of the dashboard).

## When adding/removing the DJ role from other users, the dashboard doesn't update!
In order to update users permission on the dashboard, one must disconnect from the voice channel and join again.

## None of the above fixed my issue :(
