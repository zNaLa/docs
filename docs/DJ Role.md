Your friends have great tastes in music and you want them to host a super funky music event, but they are lacking power to control Rythm. So what now? Luckily, you can create a `DJ` role to give others more permissions over Rythm!

## What does DJ role do??
DJ role grants you more access to Rythm. You can refer to **[here](/permissions#user-alone-with-rythmuser-with-a-dj-role-or-the-manage-channels-permission)** to learn more about what DJ users can do.

## Setting up DJ role
:::note
You need `Manage Roles` permission to create and assign roles in your server.
:::
1. **Create a DJ role:**
    - Go to your server settings.

    ![OpenSettings](/img/docs/dj-role/server-settings.gif)

    - Head to the `Roles` section, create a new role without any special permission and name it `DJ`.
    - Click on `Save Changes` and 🎉, you just created a new DJ role. <br/>

    ![CreateDJRole](/img/docs/dj-role/setting-dj.gif)

2. **Assign the DJ role to other users:**
    - Click on their name or avatar.
    - Click on `+`
    - Choose `DJ` role.<br/>

    ![AssignDJRole](/img/docs/dj-role/assign-dj.gif)

You are all set! Rythm will automatically recognize the `DJ` role and work perfectly! Now give your friends this special role so they can spice up your server with all the blasting music!
