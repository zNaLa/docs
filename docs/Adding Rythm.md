Ready to invite Rythm into your server? You can add any release of Rythm that you want by going [here](https://rythmbot.co/releases). We have 3 bots for your need so you can add as many as you want!

## Step one

Once you've chosen the release of Rythm that you would like to invite from the link above and you are logged into the correct Discord account, you should now see a menu like this:

![Discord Authorization Screen](/img/docs/adding/discord-oauth2-1.png)

If you press on **Select a server**, a pop-up should appear that will let you select where you'd like to add Rythm. In this case, we'll add the bot to **User's Server**. [If you don't see your server in this drop-down, click here!](/invite_troubleshooting#when-adding-rythm-i-cant-see-my-server-in-the-list)

![Choose the server that you'd like and continue](/img/docs/adding/discord-oauth2-2.png)

## Step two

Once you've selected the server that you'd like to add Rythm to, you can press the **Continue** button on the bottom right of the menu.

You should now see something similar to this:

![Press authorize and you'll be good to go!](/img/docs/adding/discord-oauth2-3.png)

## Final Step

Once you press the **Authorize** button and complete the Captcha, you should be redirected [here](https://rythmbot.co/thanks). In addition, you'll also see a message like the one below in your Discord server. **Amazing!**

Now let's get the party started by [playing some songs](/play_song)!
